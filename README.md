# ElastiCore - Fault-Tolerant Distributed Data Processing System in Go 

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## 📜 Introduction

ElastiCore is a robust and scalable fault-tolerant distributed system built in Go, designed to handle massive data processing with efficiency and resilience.

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ **Fault Tolerance**: Implements the Raft consensus algorithm for master node replication, ensuring high availability and reliability.
- ✅ **Data Replication**: Includes data replication mechanisms for enhanced data durability in case of node failures.
- ✅ **Load Balancing**: Utilizes a load balancer to evenly distribute incoming requests, optimizing resource utilization.
- ✅ **Scalability**: Easily scales horizontally by adding more worker nodes or master nodes to accommodate growing data processing demands.
- ✅ **Security**: Incorporates authentication and encryption for secure data transmission and access control.

    subgraph Master Node
    A[Master] -->|Task Distribution| B((Worker 1))
    A[Master] -->|Task Distribution| C((Worker 2))
    A[Master] -->|Task Distribution| D((Worker 3))
    end

    subgraph Worker Nodes
    B((Worker 1)) -->|Data Processing| E((Result 1))
    C((Worker 2)) -->|Data Processing| F((Result 2))
    D((Worker 3)) -->|Data Processing| G((Result 3))
    end

    subgraph Load Balancer
    H[Load Balancer] --> A[Master]
    end

    subgraph Data Storage
    E((Result 1)) -->|Data Replication| I((Data Store 1))
    F((Result 2)) -->|Data Replication| I((Data Store 1))
    G((Result 3)) -->|Data Replication| I((Data Store 1))
    end

    subgraph Clients
    J[Client 1] -->|Data Request| H[Load Balancer]
    J[Client 1] -->|Data Request| H[Load Balancer]
    J[Client 1] -->|Data Request| H[Load Balancer]
    end
```

- 💡 The "ElastiCore" system is orchestrated by the 🧠 "Master" node, which intelligently distributes tasks to 🛠️ "Worker" nodes.

- 💪 Each "Worker" node processes the assigned tasks with determination and produces valuable "Results." 🛠️

- ⚖️ The "Load Balancer" efficiently distributes incoming client requests across multiple "Master" nodes, ensuring fairness and resource optimization. ⚙️

- 📁 Data Replication: The processed 📊Results are replicated and stored in a 🗄️Data Store to ensure data durability and resilience in the face of potential failures.

- 💻 Client Interaction: 🧑‍💻Clients interact with the system by sending data processing requests to the 🚦Load Balancer, initiating the data processing workflow.
