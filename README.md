## 📜 Introduction

ElastiCore is a robust and scalable fault-tolerant distributed system built in Go, designed to handle massive data processing with efficiency and resilience.

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ **Fault Tolerance**: Implements the Raft consensus algorithm for master node replication, ensuring high availability and reliability.
- ✅ **Data Replication**: Includes data replication mechanisms for enhanced data durability in case of node failures.
- ✅ **Load Balancing**: Utilizes a load balancer to evenly distribute incoming requests, optimizing resource utilization.
- ✅ **Scalability**: Easily scales horizontally by adding more worker nodes or master nodes to accommodate growing data processing demands.
- ✅ **Security**: Incorporates authentication and encryption for secure data transmission and access control.
